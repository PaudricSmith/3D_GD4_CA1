## Morgue Escape, Paudric Smith

### Description
3D mystery puzzle game made with Unity 3D for my 4th year 3D Game Development assignment.

### Backstory/Context
You play as ‘Cristian Rieper’ a Coroner working the night shift at the morgue in the fictional city of Lunaia (pronounced ‘Lune-eye-a’) Romania. Your car was just stolen so you get the late bus and walks down the alley, unlocks the door, and go about your business. All seems normal until you find yourself locked in. You have been locked in and don’t know why. Try to escape and find out why along the way.

### Game Keywords
3 keywords best describing what I would like to achieve with my game would be, **Mysteriousness**, **Cogitation** and **Profound**. 
**Mysteriousness** – The game is at heart supposed to be a mystery because the player does not know why someone is targeting him, his car was stolen and why they locked him in the morgue. That can be achieved by not letting the user know too much to early but a little bit at a time. 
**Cogitation** – The user will have to think hard about how to solve the puzzles and must think outside the box. For one of the puzzles there is a cadaver on the table with a bullet hole in his head and on his documents, it says, “An artist, always had drawing on his mind”. You must extract the bullet and insert a pencil into the hole. So, I intend to make a lot of the puzzles like that were you must figure things out.
**Profound** – The user could feel a deep connection with the game by the music as it can create these pathways. Behind the basic plot I want there to be a deeper meaning that may or may not be very obscure but should be felt subconsciously even if not acknowledged consciously. Maybe a moral lesson learned from the mistakes the player made in the past like putting someone to sleep because they asked him to even though the family members didn’t want that and now someone is getting revenge. 

### Mood, Tone, atmosphere outline
I will use post-processing effects to change the players screen when something happens. If the player gets poisoned or eats too much medication then adding a Bloom effect and make things look a bit brighter, adding a small dark Vignette to close the circle of vision, and adding a strong Chromatic Aberration effect to really distort the players reality as it will look like wearing 3D glasses.
I might use a red Vignette that increases in saturation and size as a way of telling the user about their health status. For a cutscene I will use a medium Film Grain effect to show that it is a memory.

The non-diegetic music playing in the background will set the mood of what the user should be feeling. I wish to make a mystery puzzle game which builds up with a bit of horror in the final third and is broken up into scenes. The first scene is the main menu which should be an overture of the story which is melancholic so will use a piano with minor chords and a ghostly wind effect. The player starts off in the big city which has no danger but a lot of finding your feet with controls and NPC interaction, and I want to build the suspense so something Jazzy with a little bit of eeriness. 

The next scene is the main scene were most of the game will take place in a morgue were the player has to quickly find his way out and come across some ghouls so the background music will have to build in pitch with a repeating rhythm like a heart beating louder and louder. There will be ambience triggered when something bad happens to let the user know they did something wrong or bad like if the player opens a door where a ghoul is then a sombre ambience will play. When the player solves a puzzle, the user will hear a win jingle of sorts.

The main menu will be an interactable bathroom cupboard with a flickering light with two doors. If the player clicks on the left door, it slides open, and the player can then click on one of two doctor models. One will be to play and the other for options, click on them and the player will grab it then the loading screen appears. The right door only has one model which could be some poison which will exit the game if selected.
The colour scheme portrays a rustic used and authentic aura.
