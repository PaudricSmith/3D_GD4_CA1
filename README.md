### Description
3D mystery puzzle game made with Unity 3D for my 4th year 3D Game Development assignment.

#### Backstory/Context
You play as ‘Tobias Rieper’ a Coroner working the night shift at the morgue in the fictional city of Lunaia (pronounced ‘Lune-eye-a’) Romania. You get the late bus and walks down the alley, unlocks the door, and go about your business. All seems normal until you find yourself locked in. You have been locked in and don’t know why. Try to escape and find out why along the way.
